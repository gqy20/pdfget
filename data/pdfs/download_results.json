      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The auxin response factor (ARF) is a key regulator involved in plant growth, development, and stress response. In this study, we systematically identified the ARF gene family using a pan-genomic approach based on 47 high-quality potato genomes.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 28 members of the potato ARF pan-gene family, no core or private genes were identified. Only one gene was classified as near-core, while the remaining genes were considered non-essential. Ka/Ks analysis indicated that a single gene was under positive selection, whereas the rest of the family members were subject to purifying selection. Structural variations across the 21 potato genomes did not significantly alter the expression of ARF pan-gene family members, and no notable expression differences were detected. However, these structural variations did lead to changes in conserved domains in certain strains. RNA-seq analysis revealed differential expression of ARF family members under drought stress compared to control conditions, with variation in expression levels among different genes. Further investigation suggested that transcription factors are involved in regulating the expression of ARF gene family members.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings revealed the function of the auxin response-factor family members in biological processes in potato, and provide a new theoretical reference for drought resistance-breeding in this important crop species.",

      "abstract": "Pan-genome analysis is a crucial method for studying genomic dynamics. By creating pan-genome maps for prokaryotic organisms, we can gain valuable insights into their genetic diversity and ecological adaptability. However, current analytical methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, and they tend to provide primarily qualitative results. This study introduces PGAP2, an integrated software package that simplifies various processes, including data quality control, pan-genome analysis, and result visualization. PGAP2 facilitates the rapid and accurate identification of orthologous and paralogous genes by employing fine-grained feature analysis within constrained regions. Our systematic evaluation with simulated and gold-standard datasets demonstrates that PGAP2 is more precise, robust, and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for large-scale pan-genome data. Furthermore, PGAP2 introduces four quantitative parameters derived from the distances between or within clusters, enabling detailed characterization of homology clusters. Finally, we validate our quantitative findings by applying PGAP2 to construct a pan-genomic profile of 2794 zoonotic Streptococcus suis strains. This analysis offers new insights into the genetic diversity of S. suis, thereby enhancing our understanding of its genomic structure.

      "abstract": "The promising biocontrol agent <i>Brevibacillus brevis</i> is a broadly dispersed bacterium exhibiting significant antibacterial properties against plant diseases. This study conducted a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of 25 <i>B. brevis</i> strains to examine their taxonomic classification, genetic diversity, and biocontrol potential. The genome sizes, excluding strain NEB573, varied from 5.95 to 6.73 Mb, with GC content between 47.0% and 47.5%. Notably, strain NEB573 exhibited distinct genomic characteristics based on Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), digital DNA-DNA hybridisation (dDDH), and phylogenetic analyses, suggesting it may represent a novel <i>Brevibacillus</i> species pending additional phenotypic confirmation. The remaining 24 strains were grouped into six phylogenetic clades. The pan-genome study demonstrated significant genomic flexibility, demonstrating an open architecture with 2855 core gene families (33.08%) and 1699 distinct genes. Functional annotations indicated that unique genes were enriched in tasks related to DNA repair and environmental adaptation, while core genes predominantly participated in amino acid metabolism and transcription. The examination of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identified multiple antimicrobial compounds, such as gramicidin and tyrocidine, which have been reported to exhibit both antibacterial and antifungal activities, thereby underscoring the broad-spectrum biocontrol potential of <i>B. brevis</i>. These findings endorse the application of biocontrol in sustainable plant disease management and offer novel perspectives on its genetic basis in <i>B. brevis</i>. Future investigations of its metabolic repertoire may unveil novel agro-biotechnological applications.",

      "abstract": "Wheat is the most widely cultivated crop in the world, with over 215 million hectares grown annually. The 10+ Wheat Genomes Project recently sequenced and assembled to chromosome-level the genomes of nine wheat cultivars, uncovering genetic diversity and selection within the pan-genome of wheat. Here, we provide a wheat pan-transcriptome with de novo annotation and differential expression analysis for these wheat cultivars across multiple tissues. Using the de novo annotations we identify cultivar-specific genes and define the core and dispensable genomes. Expression analysis across cultivars and tissues reveals conservation in expression between a large core set of homeologous genes, in addition to widespread changes in subgenome homeolog expression bias between cultivars and cultivar-specific expression profiles. We utilise both the newly constructed gene-based wheat pan-genome and pan-transcriptome, demonstrating variation in the prolamin superfamily and immune-reactive proteins across cultivars.",
